# mission-control-gui
A GUI that is made to resemble a typical data stream that would be helpful to a rocket mission control.

Updates:
- Started this project, I will not be working on this as much as my other projects as all of the code is on ym laptop which I do not use as much as my PC
- Working through to other functions as the live data plot will be worked on later (5/2/2021)
- Moved scripts to VS Code (5/3/2021)
- Fixed issue with data readout moving to the middle of GUI, posting updated code (5/4/2021)
